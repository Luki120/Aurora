## Features

* A simple password manager built with Ruby, Gtk3 and Glade for the UI. Supports generating an alphanumeric string with symbols and of custom length, copying it to the clipboard, saving a specific item with a name, username/email and/or custom notes, and also editing/deleting current items. All data gets saved to json files, this could probably be improved though.

##  Socials

## Contributing

* Contributions are more than welcomed, but should follow this etiquette:
* Push small commits (e.g if you changed 2 directories, commit one directory, then commit the other directory and only THEN push)
* Keep commit titles short and then explain them in comments.
* If you're a contributor with write access to this repository, you **should NOT** push to main branch, preferably push to a new branch and *then* create the PR.
